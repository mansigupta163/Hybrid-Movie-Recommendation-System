# Hybrid-Movie-Recommendation-System
A common approach is to use content based or hybrid recommendation,combining content based recommendation with collaborative filtering. However, the hybrid approaches most commonly only integrate information about the recommended items, which can be modelled as a similarity metric between items and thus integrates easily in an item-based recommender model. Those approaches are therefore useful to deal with cold start for new content, but do not help with recommendations for new users. Other recommenders use user neighbourhoods (user based recommendation) and thus can easily integrate demographic information, but few systems can include both user and item information in combination with interaction data.
An interesting approach that allows to integrate both user and item information is the use of machine learning to learn a projection from user- or item-features directly into the feature space used by an SVD-recommender . I opted for a simpler alternative, also using a matrix factorization (or SVD) recommender, that maps demographics, content features, and other information directly onto user or item preference vectors, making that information an integral part in the entire transformation process.
